# VillageInfo

Liteloader mod for Minecraft 1.12.2.

Inspired by Chunkbase's VillageInfo mod and Bukkit's VillageInfo plugin.

Show village info in chat area with /vi command and in "F3 debug screen". (In SinglePlayer only)

HUD display is toggled by F3 by default.
Villageinfo HUD display on debug screen can be turned off completely in liteloader config panel.

Very primitive version!
